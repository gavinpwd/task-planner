(Generation :: Academy Xi  |  Junior Web Developer Program)

Our Task Planner web app was created using the following:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Bootstrap v4.5.2
JQuery v3.5.1
Popper JS v1.16.1
Unsplash API
Google Fonts API
Font Awesome Icons v4.7.0 API
Jasmine v3.6.0


Our Design Goals:
1. Interface should convey sense of calm, fun and happiness
2. A simple web layout with intuitive menu controls
3. Task lists should echo Post-It Notes
4. Typography should be well-considered
5. Strategic use of colours and icons
7. Use of white space, soft colours and single image
8. Show calendar and time (simple but animated, if possible)
9. Mobile-friendly layout
10. Consider using floating elements, transparency, opacity, shadows 


Our Coding Goals:
1. Use comments strategically
2. Codes should be well organised and easy to read
3. Create separate .js and .css files for better organisation
4. Utilise documentation from Bootstrap, MDN and W3CSchools website
5. Reference any external code sources used
6. Use at least one API as part of the project


Trajectory of this project:

4. An Edit function for each Task List
5. Ability to customise page with different background image, colour scheme and text size
6. Improved Validation code
